These literatures outline the level of quantitative proteomics QC that we aspire to: 

[A Framework for Quality Control in Quantitative Proteomics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00363)

[Ultra-fast label-free quantification and comprehensive proteome coverage with narrow-window data-independent acquisition](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-02099-7)

[Evaluating the Performance of the Astral Mass Analyzer for Quantitative Proteomics Using Data-Independent Acquisition](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00357)
